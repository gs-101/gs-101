* Introduction

Hello, I'm Gabriel! I'm an aspiring software engineer studying to enter my state's public university.

* Interests

** [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]

Emacs is not just a text editor, it's a full on application enviroment, with support for web browsing, e-mail, code editing...

I hope to contribute more to the community in the future. For now, I have a configuration that takes inspiration from many users of the community.

*** [[https://github.com/magit/magit][Magit]]

It's a great git interface for Emacs. This file was pushed to Github using it! It's maintained by [[https://github.com/tarsius][Jonas]], a prominent member of the community.

** [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]]

This README was written using Org Mode! I used markdown before, but Org Mode is perfect for Emacs.
